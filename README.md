# SincNet-used-for-Parkinsons-Disease-detection
This is what I did as my master's project. First of all are the preprocessing steps done on signals for preparation and denoising using MATLAB and EEGLAB. 
Then are python codes used for training and testing a Convolutional Neural Network beased on SincNet.
